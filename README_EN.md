# Ball Simulator

This is an interactive physics simulator developed using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Key Features

- Dynamic Responsive Canvas: Automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes
- Physics Simulation:
  - Friction simulation
  - Boundary collision detection and rebound
- Visualized Motion Trajectory: Uses arrows to indicate the ball's direction and velocity
- Real-time Data Display:
  - Mouse position coordinates
  - Distance between the ball and the mouse
  - Ball velocity components

## Usage Guide

1. Open [ball.html](https://onenok.github.io/ball.html/)
2. Move your mouse to influence the ball's motion trajectory

## Technical Implementation

- Utilizes HTML5 Canvas API for 2D rendering
- Implemented in native JavaScript with no external dependencies
- Custom physics simulation including:
  - Velocity and position calculations
  - Collision detection and response
  - Friction effects
